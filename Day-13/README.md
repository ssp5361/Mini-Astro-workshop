## Day 13 (October 11th, 5:30pm-07:00pm IST)

* Topic:
  * Probing Primordial Black Holes Using Gravitational Waves (Theory and Detection) - [recorded lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVcomqm1u4Y&feature=emb_logo)
  
  Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are fascinating hypothetical objects that formed a few seconds after the Big Bang. The fact that they formed from non-stellar evolution methods is what makes them so much more mysterious. Besides shedding light on the early Universe, they are also good candidates of dark matter. 
  
  In this talk, I will first provide a brief overview of what these objects are and the different theories that surround their formation in the early Universe. In the second part, I will dive into details about my own research i.e. detecting PBHs using gravitational waves detected by the LIGO/Virgo detectors. The second part is further divided into two, based on the mass range of PBHs - subsolar PBHs (<1 Msun) and supersolar PBHs in the lower mass gap region (3-5 Msun). 
 
* Instructions:
  * It might help if you have followed the previous 'Introduction to Gravitational Waves' lecture (Days 5 & 6). But it's completely alright even if you haven't - I'll be trying to explain everything as simply as possible! 

* Resources:

  There are very few books about PBHs - personally, I've only relied on various lectures and papers.
