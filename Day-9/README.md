## Day 9 (October 6th, 05:30pm IST)
* Topics:
  * Part 1: Introduction to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.
  * Part 2: Introduction to Extreme Mass Ratio black hole Binary source modelling.
  
    Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is the upcoming space borne laser interferometer to detect gravitational waves in mHz range. I will be talking about the orbit and the stabilization of the 3 space crafts. I will also be talking about its primary source which is Extreme Mass Ratio black hole Binaries. I will discuss what challenges lie ahead in modelling of Gravitational Wave sources for LISA and why discontinuous Galerkin method is a good candidate for the algorithm to be used.
